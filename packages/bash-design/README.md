# Bash Design

Welcome to the Allowance Design System, **Bash Design**.

## Getting Started

Bash Design is built on top of [Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com/) and holds the tokens and receipes that make up the Allowance design and brand guidelines.

It uses the "[Include the Src Files](https://panda-css.com/docs/guides/component-library#include-the-src-files)" method to be used across applications in a monorepo environment.

If you make changes to ```recipes``` or ```tokens``` you need to run ```pnpm prepare``` for the changes to take affect.
